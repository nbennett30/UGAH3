Hex Hunter is an Android app that produces a random *hexadecimal* RGB value, and the player tries to find a color in the real world that matches the random value with his/her camera! Developed for UGA Hacks 3 over a 15 hour period.

## Instructions
Simply point to an item that seems to have the same color as the random value, and hit the button. If you lose, nothing will happen.
